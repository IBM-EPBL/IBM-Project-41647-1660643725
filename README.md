ABSTRACT
       Student admission for the Master’s degree program consists of different criteria/scores which is taken into consideration before admitting the
student to the degree program. This process is elaborative and requires lot of thought processing and analysis by the selection committee before 
choosing the right applicants to the Master’s degree program. The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate the top contributing scores which helps the student
to get the admission into the Master’s degree program. The analysis might seem straight forward but caution has to be exercised to consider the scores like
GRE, TOEFL, university rating, SOP, LOR and CGPA and any outliers should not impact the decision making process.
